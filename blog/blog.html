				<h2>Thoughts on my Tech Journey</h2>

				<p class="tldr">TLDR - Life. Is. Wild...</p>

				<p class="postText">
					I finally got around to looking into my site again. I fixed some links. Played with some styles. Then I got to the blog page. Reading the date of my last post kinda blew me away... Feburary 8th, 2021. I was still working in Tech Support. It was a hard time. Don't get me wrong, it was a great company.. but life in that world is grueling. Me and my wife were still living in our small apartment. Due to space constraints, my work dest was in our bedroom, literally rignt next to my bed. I used my work desk as a night stand.
				</p>

				<p class="postText"> 
					I remember feeling this constant panic. "I need to move up in the tech world" I'd tell myself. It's weird how looking back I don't know if I could have even planned the path to where I'm at now. I was working at Adobe (I was at Workfront Inc. but they were just acquired by Adobe so I was moved over.). I'd still be there for another 8 months before I got a message on LinkedIn about a System Admin role at MasterControl. Making that change blew me away. I remember that was the first time I felt like I actually mattered at a job, and wasn't just an expendable.
				</p>

				<p class="postText">
					I learned more and more. I learned and sharpened skills. I didn't just solve problems anymore, but I architected automations and integrations. Then, there were layoffs. It's weird getting layed off. It's scary. It's sickening. But, it's also a path to growth. Had I not had that push, I'd probably still be there. I was forced to once again push myself to learn more and grow. 
				</p>

				<p class="postText">
					We had just bought a house and it was three brain-numbing months of stress before I found my next gig. I really am grateful that it wasn't longer. There were others that couldn't find anything for much, much longer. Again, I moved up. I got a spot as a Senior Digital Solutions Consultant. Around September/October of 2025, I decided I was going to start working out again. I had quit smoking and drinking. I was lifting consistantly. I'm learning German and Python. I've built dozens of integrations and automations. 
				</p>

				<p class="postText">
					I know this isn't really a technical post, but I just thought it interesting how life has a way of derailing you. Oddly, these derailments are really just opportunities. If you don't choose to push yourself, life will. When it does, you can choose to grow or not. I'm curious where I'll be in 5, or 10 more years... We'll see.

				<h2>React</h2>

				<p class="tldr">TLDR - What is React? How do I use it? What the blast am I even doing??</p>

				<p class="postText">
					They say 'If You’re Feeling Uncomfortable, That’s when growth happens'. I think that's a feeling I've been accepting. I don't think you really get used to it, but it maybe more something you forget is there, or it ebbs the more you grow, then you forget how strong it felt in the beginning.
				</p>

				<p class="postText"> 
					It always feels like that when I dive into a new technology. That feeling of uneasiness. Maybe I'm painting this in too much of a harsh light. It's not that it's bad, it's more of a question 'Where do I begin?'. There's always my trusty tools I go to.. Youtube, Google, code forums. Thus was how my journey into React started.
				</p>

				<p class="postText">
					On a basic level, I knew what it was. A Javascript framework, right? It's one of those keywords you hear at some point in tech. As some point though, you just have to dive right in. You can watch all you want how to ride a bike, but until you get one one and bomb down a hill (as in my case), you'll never learn how to do it.

				<h2>Random Quote Generator</h2>

				<p class="tldr">TLDR - Generates random bodybuilding quotes using an API. Ran into issues incorporating the API data, but was able to work throug them pretty easy</p>

				<p class="postText">
					This one was a pretty fun project to work on. Most of it was pretty strait forward. I ran into most of my issues when trying to implement the API portion. My first issue was I needed a key, but that was pretty easy to work around. Next, after running several tests, I kept getting a "Cors" error. I found a few workarounds for this one, but eventually shifted to another API (originally it was an API with motivational quotes, but I found another that had bodybuilding quotes I liked better). I didn't run into the error with this new API.
				</p>

				<p class="postText">
					The hard part was pulling the data I needed from the response. After digging through the json a bit, I found the correct endpoints. At first, I felt a bit lost.. but in the sense that I was blind and knew braille (I knew how to use an API) and was given a map in braille. I had to comb over it several times until I got a bit more familure with it and could find my way around the data.
				</p>

				<p class="postText">
					Once I had this, plugging in the peaces was pretty easy. I did run into a few other minor issues, but most of it was due to typos in the code.
