      <h2 class="fire">My journey began with an interest in emergency services. I attended school for Firefighting and EMT-B certifications.</h2>
      <h2 class="fire">I loved it. We covered emergency methods for treating critical injuries, how to use a plethora of medical devices, ran live simulations (including pulling people out of a smoke
        filled building
        and performing triage and treatment).
      </h2>
      <h2 class="fire firelast">Learning about the lack of jobs at the time, and having a daughter on the way, I became discouraged and felt I needed something more reliable. At the time, there was an explosion of
        coding
        bootcamps.
        Learning more about them, I found DevMountain, and decided to apply...</h2>

    <div class="parallaxDark" data-parallax="scroll" data-image-src="../images/devmountain.jpg">
      <h2>I had no prior experience with coding or Web Development before applying. When I learned about the Bootcamp, it was starting within just a few weeks. There were some prerequisite course work, but I lacked the time to complete it all.</h2>
      <h2>I was able to finish all the HTML and CSS content, but yet to get to any of the JavaScript content they recommended. The first few parts of the class went seamless.. Then we transitioned into JS, frameworks, and some databases. I felt
        completely lost, but I powered through it.</h2>
      <h2>I graduated from the Bootcamp, but struggled to still find a job. After working odd jobs in sales, construction, and tech support, a friend told me about underwater welding, which he had just completed school for his diving and welding
        certs. All I could think was how amazing that world sounded, and decided to dive in...</h2>

      <h2>The first time I took a breath underwater was like no other feeling I had felt before. I knew at that moment that this was what I wanted to do. I completed my diving certs, and felt like I finally knew what my path in life was.</h2>
      <h2>However, fate had other plans. On one dive, I could not equalize the pressure in one of my ears fast enough, and pushed to descend faster than I should have. Feeling the pop in my ear was one of the scariest moments Iâ€™ve had. I knew I had ruptured my eardrum. Knowing that many jobs would require a fast descent, and that this would continue to cause issues, I knew I needed to find something else...</h2>

      <h2>Each time I left tech for something else, I kept feeling it pull me back. I loved it. I loved seeing how everything worked together. As a kid, I would take apart various things around the house to see how they worked (which I'm sure my Mother just loved).</h2>
      <h2>Inevitably, I made my way back into tech. I've worked in tech support for years, and gained an in depth knoledge of various tools and technologies, while also developing solid troubleshooting and investigation skills.</h2>
      <h2>It's the world of tech that excites me. It's all the possibilities it creates and problems it can solve.</h2>
