      <h2 class="fire">My professional journey started with a passion for emergency services. I enrolled in school for Firefighting and EMT certifications.</h2>
      
      <h2 class="fire">I loved every moment of it. We learned emergency methods for treating critical injuries, how to use a variety of medical devices, and ran live simulations — including pulling people out of smoke-filled buildings and performing triage and treatment.</h2>
      
      <h2 class="fire firelast">However, as I discovered the limited job opportunities in the field at the time, and with a daughter on the way, I became discouraged and realized I needed a more stable career. Around that time, coding bootcamps were booming. After researching them, I found DevMountain and decided to take the leap...</h2>

    <div class="parallaxDark" data-parallax="scroll" data-image-src="../images/devmountain.jpg">
      <h2>I had no prior experience with coding or web development when I first applied to the Bootcamp. The program was starting in just a few weeks, and while there was some prerequisite coursework, I didn’t have the time to complete it all.</h2>
      
      <h2>Despite that, I managed to finish the HTML and CSS modules, but hadn’t even started the JavaScript content they recommended. The first part of the class went smoothly, but when we transitioned into JavaScript, frameworks, and databases, I felt completely overwhelmed. Still, I pushed through.</h2>
      
      <h2>After graduating from the Bootcamp, I struggled to land a job. I worked odd jobs in sales, construction, and tech support. Then a friend, who had just completed his underwater welding certification, introduced me to the world of welding. Intrigued by the idea, I decided to dive in and explore this new path...</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="parallax" data-parallax="scroll" data-image-src="../images/dive.jpeg">
      <h2>The first time I took a breath underwater, it was unlike anything I had ever experienced. I absolutely loved it. Earning my diving certifications made me feel like I was finally on the right path.</h2>
      
      <h2>However, I soon discovered that I had trouble equalizing the pressure in my ears. During one dive, I even blew out an eardrum. As much as I loved diving, I realized that pursuing it professionally just wasn't going to be possible for me.</h2>
      
      <h2>Though the dream didn’t work out, it led me to new opportunities and perspectives...</h2>

      <h2>I found my way back to the tech world. I started in tech support, where I developed invaluable troubleshooting skills. I then transitioned into systems administration, where I gained experience optimizing systems, building integrations, and automating workflows to improve efficiency. Now, I’m a Senior Digital Solutions Consultant, leveraging my expertise to design and implement strategic solutions.</h2>

      <h2>I’m always curious about tech, thinking 'I wonder if I can build this... let’s figure it out". I'm constantly exploring new projects—whether they’re things I’ve been wanting to try or ideas I’m actively working on.</h2>

      <h2>As a kid, I’d often take things apart just to see what was inside and how they functioned. My curiosity drives everything I do. I’m always asking questions, exploring new ideas, and challenging myself to discover what’s possible.</h2>
